we present “iProm-Archaea”, a novel CNN-based tool for precise archaeal promoter prediction. Our method systematically assesses several feature encoding schemes and finds 6-mer frequency as the best representation to capture promoter motifs. For model training, we utilized experimentally validated archaeal promoters from Sulfolobus solfataricus, Haloferax volcanii, and Thermococcus kodakarensis. And T. Kodakarensis KOD1 for independent testing. iProm-Archaea achieves 92% accuracy on training data and 89% on an independent test dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Cross-organism analysis reveals limited generalizability to prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters, underscoring the distinct regulatory architecture of archaea. To facilitate practical use, we have developed a user-friendly webserver. Moreover, we leverage iProm-Archaea and annotate 5,86,455 archaeal promoters from 478 unannotated archaea organisms. This work advances archaeal genomics by offering a robust, domain-specific tool for archaeal promoter detection.
